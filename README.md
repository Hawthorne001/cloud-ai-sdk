## About
Qualcomm Cloud AI 100 provides a unique blend of high computational performance, low latency and low power utilization for deep learning inference and is well suited for a broad range of applications based on computer vision, natural language processing, and Generative AI including LLMs. It was purpose-built for high performance, low-power AI processing in the cloud ‚Äì public and private (for Enterprise AI applications). 

This repository provides developers with 3 key resources
- Models    - Recipes for [CV](https://github.com/quic/cloud-ai-sdk/tree/1.12/models/vision), [NLP/LLMs/GenAI](https://github.com/quic/cloud-ai-sdk/tree/1.12/models/language_processing), [multimodal](https://github.com/quic/cloud-ai-sdk/tree/1.12/models/multimodal/text_to_image) models to run on Cloud AI platforms performantly. For LLMs, see [efficient-transformers](https://github.com/quic/efficient-transformers)
- Tutorials - [Tutorials](https://github.com/quic/cloud-ai-sdk/tree/1.12/tutorials) cover model onboarding, performance tuning, and profiling aspects of inferencing across CV/NLP on Cloud AI platforms 
- Samples   - Sample code illustrating usage of APIs - [Python](https://github.com/quic/cloud-ai-sdk/tree/1.12/samples/python) and [C++](https://github.com/quic/cloud-ai-sdk/tree/1.12/samples/cpp/cpp_qpc_inference) for inference on Cloud AI platforms
